Hi! I am Max, an incoming student at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/) where I study discrete mathematics.
I love pure and discrete mathematics as well as coding in rust (my beautiful) which I suppose makes my university course a good fit?
Also, I play trumpet and violin. Generally also, classical music, in my opinion, is quite amazing.
