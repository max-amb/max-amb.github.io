Hi! I am Max, a first year student at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/) where I study discrete mathematics.
I love pure mathematics as well as coding in rust (my beautiful) and Nix which I suppose makes my university course a good fit?
Also, I play trumpet and violin, and I enjoy classical music (perhaps by extension).
I would love to talk to anyone about these fields so please get in touch!
